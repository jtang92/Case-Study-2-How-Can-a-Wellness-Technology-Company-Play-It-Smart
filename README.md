# Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This github page contains the code, data analysis, and data visualization case study project for the fictional company, Bellabeat.

The [.rmd](https://github.com/jtang92/Case-Study-2-How-Can-a-Wellness-Technology-Company-Play-It-Smart/blob/main/Case%20Study.R) file contains my thought process and the codes when preparing, cleaning, and formatting the data for analysis in RStudio.

Once completed, the data is uploaded to Tableau to create visualizations. Based on the business ask, I have created the following four visualizations:

## Visualization 1 - Activity
### Based on the findings on activity, we can see that on average the clients spend almost 1,000 minutes (16 hours) per day being sendentary, while participating in 20 minutes on heavy activity.

## Visualization 2 - Caloric intake
### Based on the caloric intake, we can predict that our clients are not active enough for the amount of calories they are consuming.

## Visualization 3 - Sleep
### Clients spend roughly 7 hours per day asleep, so we can safely assume they get 7.5 ~ 8 hours of bed time.

## Visualization 4 - Weight (in kilograms)
### The average weight shows a lot of fluctuations day-by-day which likely indicates that users are not reporting their weights on a daily basis, or is not reporting accurate figures, as weight should not drastically change within a day or two.

# In conclusion
#### **1. What are some trends in smart device usage?**
Based on the analysis and visualizations, we can estimate that the user base is not exercising or being active enough for the amount of calories they are consuming. They are getting enough rest, however it is important that they spend more time staying active.


#### **2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?**
In order to maintain an accurate reading, and for the app to make better personalized nutritional and fitness goals, users should be reminded to update their weight on a daily basis.


#### **3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?**
The marketing department should emphasize the benefits of using the application, such as features to remind the user to be more active when they are sedentary for too long. The app could also feature low calorie meals that are more suitable to the user's preference so they can lower their caloric intake.
